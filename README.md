# USPSValidator
A command line utility that scrapes the USPS website to cleanse and format addresses.

Usage: 
The application was initially created to read from a SQL database but is now a standalone console application. Simply feed it your addresses, and it will return USPS-formatted address data along with missing fields like the ZIP+4. 

Output is straight to the console but also easily modified to export to a CSV or a filetype of your choosing.
